Weâ€™re happy to announce the release of napari 0.5.5! (You might have noticed it's been a hot minute since our last release â€” the team has been busy on the conference circuit (watch [our talk at PyConAU](https://youtu.be/EYmTLGwScBI?si=5SUqxVYuhyAmlD6H)!), defending their PhDs, and more! We are now back to our regularly-scheduled programming. ðŸ˜‚

napari is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python. Itâ€™s designed for exploring, annotating, and analyzing multi-dimensional images. Itâ€™s built on Qt (for the GUI), VisPy (for performant GPU-based rendering), and the scientific Python stack (NumPy, SciPy, and friends).
