This is primarily a bug-fix release, but we snuck a couple of new features in
there, including smoother, prettier, better rendering of Labels volumes in 3D
([#7100](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/7100)) and the ability to
display scale bar at a fixed length in world coordinates, rather than having it
resize dynamically to take up a small part of the screen
([#7167](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/7100)).

See below for the full list of changes!
