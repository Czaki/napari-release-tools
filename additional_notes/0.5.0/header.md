candidate testing.*

We're happy to announce the release of napari 0.5.0!
napari is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python.
It's designed for exploring, annotating, and analyzing multi-dimensional
images. It's built on top of Qt (for the GUI), VisPy (for performant GPU-based
rendering), and the scientific Python stack (NumPy, SciPy, and friends).
