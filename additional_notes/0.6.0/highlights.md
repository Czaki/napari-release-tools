### Updated viewer handedness âœ‹

So. Funny story. ðŸ˜…

For (checks notes) 5 years or so, napari has had a 3D view, and for those 5
years, for almost all datasets, that view has been a *mirror image* of the 3D
object they were trying to represent. Any biologists among you might have
noticed that loading 3D molecular coordinates of DNA would result in a
left-handed helix, while anatomists among you might have been surprised by how
many of your samples suffered from [situs inversus
totalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situs_inversus)!

By and large, many things that people care about work exactly the same in the
mirror world â€” volume measurements, forces, tracking, speed, ... â€” so this bug
has gone mostly unnoticed, or noticed and shrugged off and unfixed for all this
time. But it's important for some things!  Your heart is on the left side of
your body, but the right side of your mirror image's. This can be critical, for
example, when using software to plan surgery! Thankfully, we are not aware of
any cases of napari being used in this way. ðŸ˜…

napari uses zyx coordinates instead of xyz because it is the most natural way
to work with NumPy arrays and the rest of the scientific Python imaging
ecosystem. Flipping the axes in this way also changes the *handedness* of the
space, *unless* you also flip the direction of one of the dimensions. The
simplest way to illustrate this is [this 3D model of a right
shoe](https://grabcad.com/library/anatomic-shoe-sole-euro-right-41-1), which looks
like this in previous versions of napari:

and in 0.5.6+, thanks to [#7488](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/7488):

Most users won't notice. But if you were among the users that noticed and you
implemented workarounds in your code (such as setting the z-scale to a negative
number), now is a good time to undo the workarounds for newer versions of
napari! If you run into any issues please get in touch [on GitHub
issues](https://github.com/napari/napari) or on our [Zulip chat room](https://napari.zulipchat.com)!
