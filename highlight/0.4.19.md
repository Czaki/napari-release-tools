In this release we would like to highlight three changes:

At first we have decided to postpone the `viewer.window.qt_viewer` to 0.6.0 release
as not all the features are ready yet ([napari/napari/#6283](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/6283)).

Secondly we make napari pydantic 2 compatible.
At this moment we are using `pydantic.v1` to achieve this.
In this release the bundle will be shipped with pydantic 1, but
we expect that in the next release we will ship bundle with pydantic 2.
So if your plugin is using pydantic please make sure that it is compatible with pydantic 2.

Lastly we have fixed performance problem with label layer by move part of calculation on GPU
