This release is mostly a bug fix release. We aim for the next release to be 0.5.0, with many new exciting features!

Highlights in `v0.4.19`:

The removal of public access to `viewer.window.qt_viewer` has been postponed to `v0.6.0` ([napari/napari/#6283](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/6283)). If you're interested in some feature that's currently behind private or deprecated API, please make an issue on the napari repo requesting the feature to be exposed!

napari is now pydantic 2 compatible. At this moment we are using `pydantic.v1` to achieve this. Additionally, for this release, the napari conda bundle will be shipped with pydantic v1, but
we expect that in the next release we will ship the bundle with pydantic v2.
Please, if you are a plugin developer and your plugin uses pydantic, ensure
that it is compatible with pydantic v2 ([napari/napari/#6358](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/6358)).

Performance of the `Labels` layer is drastically improved for many labels by moving part of calculations to the GPU ([napari/napari/#3308](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/3308)).

If you have any questions or suggestions regarding napari core, for example on how to adapt your plugin to be compatible with future napari versions, please get in touch! We have weekly community meetings, for which you can find the schedule [here](https://napari.org/stable/community/meeting_schedule.html). We would like to hear from you.
