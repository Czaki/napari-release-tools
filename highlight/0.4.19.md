This release is mostly a bug fix release and hopefully the latest before all the excited features that are coming with version 0.5.0.

First of all we have an important announcement with this release.
We have decided to postpone the `viewer.window.qt_viewer` to 0.6.0 release
as not all the features are ready yet ([napari/napari/#6283](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/6283)).

Furthermore we would like to highlight the following changes:

 We have made napari pydantic 2 compatible.
At this moment we are using `pydantic.v1` to achieve this.
In this release the bundle will be shipped with pydantic v1, but
we expect that in the next release we will ship the bundle with pydantic v2.
Please, if you are a plugin developer and your plugin uses pydantic, ensure 
that it is compatible with pydantic v2 ([napari/napari/#6358](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/6358)).

Also, we have fixed a performance problem of the label layer by moving part of calculations to the GPU
([napari/napari/#3308](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/3308)).

If you have any questions or suggestions regarding napari core, for example how to adapt your plugin to be compatible with future napari versions, please get in touch! We have weekly community meetings, for which you can find the schedule [here](https://napari.org/stable/community/meeting_schedule.html). We would like to hear from you.
