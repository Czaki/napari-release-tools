Subject: [PATCH] Installation guide: Mention slow first launch time (#253)

# References and relevant issues
Closes https://github.com/napari/docs/issues/222

# Description
This PR adds a `Note` that first launch may be slow on some platforms
(macOS, Windows) and that anti-malware and security software may also
result in slower launches.
It's quite disconcerting when running `napari` doesn't visually do
anything immediately!

 ## Choosing a different Qt backend

 napari needs a library called [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) to run its user interface
