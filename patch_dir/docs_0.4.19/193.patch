+## Using constraints files
+
+Since napari 0.4.18, we store constraints files with information about each exact dependency version against which napari was tested.
+This could be useful if you need to install napari as a package from PyPI, and prevents creating environments where napari does not start or work properly.
+
+The constraints files are stored in the napari repository under `resources/constraints/constraints_py3.10.txt`. To find
+constraints for specific releases, go under the link `https://github.com/napari/napari/tree/{tag}/resources/constraints`
+replacing `{tag}` with the desired napari version.
+
+```sh
+pip install napari[backend_selection] -c path/to/constraints/file
+```
+
+For example, if you would like to install napari on python 3.10:
+
+```sh
+pip install napari[all, pyqt] -c constraints_py3.10.txt
+```
