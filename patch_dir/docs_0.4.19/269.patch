Subject: [PATCH] [NAP-8] delete :orphan: (#269)

# References and relevant issues
First noted here:
https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/6384#discussion_r1385853123


# Description
There is an orphan `:orphan:` tag at the top of NAP-8. Pretty sure it's
not doing anything--the other naps don't have it. This deletes it.
