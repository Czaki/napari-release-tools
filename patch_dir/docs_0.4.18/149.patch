 follows:
 
-    1. Click mouse (left-click) to begin drawing.
-    2. Move mouse — without holding down the mouse button — to draw the polygon.
-    3. Click mouse (left-click) or press `escape` to end drawing—the polygon will auto-complete.

 The polygon lasso tool can also be used to draw `Polygons` using a tablet. In this case, 
 drawing the polygon is started by touching the tablet screen with the tablet stylus and
